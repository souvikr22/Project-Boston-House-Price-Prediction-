# Taken ‘Boston House Price’ dataset from sklearn library in python and applied ‘linear’, ‘random forest’, ‘xgboost’, ‘SVM’ regression methods to predict the house prices in Boston city. Data visualizations and pictorial analysis are also done. Finally, I have compared the accuracy of those 4 different regression methods based on its r-square value.
